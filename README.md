Users engage with people and objects to explore the significance of sociologist Ray Oldenburg's concept of "Third Places" — social spheres bridging the gap between work and home. "Digital Cafe: Exploring Online Third Places" was designed for Dr. Stephen Quigley’s ENGCMP 1130 Projects in Digital Composition.

From Feb 1st - Feb 6th, this kiosk was an installation at the Cathedral of Learning, Pittsburgh, PA–the tallest educational building in the western hemisphere! It was chosen for the Projects in Digital Composition showcase and featured in the Pitt News.
